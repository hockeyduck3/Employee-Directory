[![repo size](https://img.shields.io/github/repo-size/hockeyduck3/Employee-Directory)](https://github.com/hockeyduck3/Employee-Directory)

## Description

This project was an assignment for my Full Stack Web course. For this project I had to go and build a simple Employee Directory app from scratch using React. The employee's are auto generated from the [randomuser.me](randomuser.me) API. The app allows the user to see all of the employees in the directory at a glance. You can also sort by name or age, or you can search by first name, last name, age, or birth date.
